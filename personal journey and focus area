Hi everyone! I'm 16, from Israel, and I've decided to dedicate my journey to becoming a hedge fund manager.

I’m particularly obsessed with quant investing and using Python to model strategies. 
I know I have a long mountain to climb, but I’m starting now. If you see any flaws in my thinking or have advice on what 
I should study next (Math, CS, or Econ?), please let me know. I really value candid feedback!
